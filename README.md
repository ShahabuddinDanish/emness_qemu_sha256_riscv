#  Linux Device Driver Development for SHA256 Cryptographic Core in QEMU for RISC-V ISA

This academic project is inspired from the EMNESS project, which aims for innovation in academics on reliability and hardware security, 
and the project is an introduction to developing Linux/FreeRTOS device drivers for emulated cryptographic cores using QEMU, for RISC-V 
architecture. It also includes a detailed open access lab experience to teach the project and replicate its results.

This project is developed as part of the Operating Systems course (04JEZOQ) at Politecnico di Torino delivered by Prof. Stefano Di Carlo 
and Prof. Alessio Carpegna.

## Project Objectives

The project aims to model a SHA256 cryptographic core inside QEMU, build the QEMU virtual machine 
for RISC-V ISA, install Linux on the virtual machine, develop the device driver for the cryptocore, 
cross-compile the driver for RISC-V and test the complete system through the userspace.
